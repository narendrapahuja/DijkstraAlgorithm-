# DijkstraAlgorithm-
**Dijkstra Algorithm in Go**

**Dijkstra's algorithm** is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This project is to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm in Go.This code will give shortest path to every other node along with the cost.

**Project Members :** Shravya Donthisaram, Levi Barrantes, Zhiyan Yu, Dylan Jezo, Drew Cavanaugh and Narendra Pahuja

**Procedure to run the code:**

Open the command window in IDE.Place the program file to be executed in the current directory chosen for IDE.To run the source code, type the input in the format go run File_name.go in the IDE terminal Ex: go run Dijkstra.go

Results will be displayed in the terminal window.
